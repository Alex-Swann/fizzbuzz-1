# FizzBuzz

### Get started:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository (optional if you want to contribute).
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository) into your machine.
1. Open terminal! :wink:
1. Make sure you've got bundler installed. Run `gem install bundler`.
1. Run `bundle install` inside the directory to install gems dependencies.
1. Then run `rackup` to start a local server.
1. Make a note of the port (it should tell you in your terminal when you start the server "`port=####`"). Do not quit terminal or close rackup.
1. Go to [http://localhost:####](http://localhost:####), replacing the #### with your port number.
